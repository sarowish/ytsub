# ytsub

ytsub is a subscriptions only tui youtube client that uses the invidious api.

![demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20581722/169398500-76b61e21-bff6-4286-aadb-8345eaab97a0.gif)

## Dependencies

`mpv` and `yt-dlp` are optional dependencies for playing videos.

`sqlite` is a required dependency. If it is not available on the system,
it can be compiled and linked by enabling
the `bundled_sqlite` feature when building with cargo:

```
cargo build --features bundled_sqlite
```

## Installation

### Cargo

```bash
cargo install ytsub

# or
cargo install ytsub --features bundled_sqlite
```

### Arch Linux

`ytsub` is available in the AUR as
[stable source package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ytsub),
[stable binary package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ytsub-bin) and
[latest development package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ytsub-git).
You can install it using your preferred AUR helper.

```bash
# stable source package
paru -S ytsub

# stable binary package
paru -S ytsub-bin

# latest development package
paru -S ytsub-git
```

### `instances`

A custom path to the `instances` file can be specified with the `-i` flag.
The file can either be manually created by adding instances that have api enabled or
automatically generated from the instances in https://api.invidious.io by running the app with `-g` flag.
Every instance entry is separated by a line.
If the `instances` file doesn't exist, every time the app is launched,
instances list will be built from https://api.invidious.io.

#### Example `instances` file

```
https://vid.puffyan.us
https://invidio.xamh.de
https://inv.riverside.rocks
https://yt.artemislena.eu
```
